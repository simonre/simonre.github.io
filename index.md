I am a Computer Science student at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu) and also work as a Student Software Engineer at [inovex GmbH](https://www.inovex.de). 

# Open Source

At inovex I work on some Open Source Projects:

* [gophercloud](http://gophercloud.io/): An SDK to connect Go applications with OpenStack clouds
* [terraform-provider-openstack](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html): Enables [terraform](https://www.terraform.io) to talk to OpenStack resources.

I've also developed a food tracking app while at KIT:
* [Privacy friendly food tracker](https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-food-tracker)
